A more granular music recommendation engine for Spotify.

Deprioritises the influence of Spotify users' social matrix neighbours
in favour of tailoring recommendations based on a limited set of target
musical attributes (insofar as can be obtained or inferred from the
Spotify API).

The impetus for this project arose both from a desire to (clumsily,
hungrily) conquer oauth implementation in a web service, as well as a
nostalgic reverence for Pandora's musically conscious discovery model --
which the social data aggregation models of contemporary streaming
services often fall short of when chasing a given aural thread.
